import React from 'react';


/*
FYI! 
first install the library:
npm install react-bootstrap bootstrap
(install _both_ react-bootstrap (the react components) and bootstrap (the css styles))
and add the css styles to the project (index.html)

then import each component as you render it

it's not necessary that you use every component here, but here's a bunch of good examples.

For each component, showcase how you can customize the component via props and utilize `className` to further customize the component.
(this is to drive home the point that we'll typically be using a combination of both a Component and classnames)

            <h1>hello, world</h1>
